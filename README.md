# The Incredible Rise of UPI

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the exponential rise of UPI payments against credit and debit card transactions in India's digital payment system from Jan-21 to Jun-22. The data is sourced from the official government websites of NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) and RBI (Reserve Bank of India). The data has been processed using Power BI to create a database for easy management, analysis, and exploration of the data visually and to gain valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data of the exponential rise of UPI payments against credit and debit card transactions in India's digital payment system from Jan-21 to Jun-22. The data has been sourced from the official government websites of [NPCI](https://www.npci.org.in/) and [RBI](https://rbi.org.in/), which ensures its authenticity and reliability. The dataset includes information such as name of UPI apps, transaction values, transaction volumes and time period (date, month, year).

## Data Processing
The data obtained from the official government websites of NPCI and RBI requires some preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for analysis. Power Query Editor within Power BI has been utilized to clean, filter, and transform the data as necessary. This ensures that the data used for the dashboard is accurate and reliable.

## Technologies Used
Power Query Editor: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation into the database.

Microsoft Power BI: For data analysis and visualization.

## Key Highlights
- UPI was introduced in India in April 2016.
- Within 3 years, it surpassed credit & debit cards both in terms of value and volume of transactions.
- Within 6 years, it has grown exponentially to 8-9 times the size of the card payment market (both by value & volume).
- Debit card transactions (by volume) are declining YoY since FY1920 & credit card transactions are stagnating.
- Mobile Apps such as PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm are spearheading this Digital Payment revolution in India.
